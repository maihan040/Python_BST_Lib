# Python_BST_Lib

# Purpose:

This is an implementation of a binary search tree written in Python. Goal of this project is to build a library of functions that each can  
interact with the binary search tree to perform the desired operation, as well as explain via detalied comments how each function works.

# Motivation:

Motivation for this project was twofold: 
  
  -Become knowledgeable about git/gibhub
  -Provide a resource of Python tied together with popular Computer Science concepts

# Tech/framework used:

  Python version 3.8.5
 
# Features:

  Code will have heavy documentation throughout, which serves to clearly show the operation of each function/class.
  Relevant sections are clearly marked, to make it easer for readers to understand the flow of the overall design
